After a last minute change of plan due to the spread of Covid, we successfully ran [OBMS](http://batterymodel.ox.ac.uk) this year as an online event, welcoming 150 attendees. This was so well received that a weekly [webinar series](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/bmws.html) has also begun, building on the momentum from OBMS. Read more about all of it in this [ACS Article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c01304). We hope OBMS will be back in 2021.
