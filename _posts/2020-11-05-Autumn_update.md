We were delighted that Luis and Antti's paper on battery parameter estimation won a best paper award at the recent ASME DSCC! Also, check out Antti's other DSCC [paper](../DSCC_2020_Aitio.pdf), on extracting battery SOH from live data, as well as [work by Jie on thermal models](https://ecs.confex.com/ecs/prime2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/143387) given at ECS Prime ('virtually' Hawaii!). A very warm welcome to Dr Nicola Courtier and to Adam Lewis-Douglas, a new DPhil (doctoral) student in the group, both of them are affiliated with the [Faraday Institution](http://faraday.ac.uk). Sad goodbyes to Dr Jorn Reniers (now at Brill Power) and Dr Pedro Ascencio (who has moved back to Chile to work in industry); they will be very sorely missed.
