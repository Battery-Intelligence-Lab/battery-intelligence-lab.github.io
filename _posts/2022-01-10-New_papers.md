We start the year excited to share the publication of recent work on battery health diagnostics using machine learning. Our long-term collaboration with [BBOXX](http://www.bboxx.com) has resulted in a new Joule paper "Predicting battery end of life from solar off-grid system field data using machine learning" where we crunched 620 million rows of field data to show that battery end of life can be diagnosed directly from the data without additional sensors or the need to take systems offline. Get the paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435121005328) and open access preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13856).
