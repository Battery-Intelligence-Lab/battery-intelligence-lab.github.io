The good people at InnovateUK have made a [lovely short video](https://youtu.be/Mehia3tArkg) about the [Energy Superhub Project](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/news/university-announces-involvement-in-oxford-s-new-energy-projects/). The project will, amongst many things, connect a 50 MW battery to the transmission grid in Oxford. We're super-excited to be involved.
