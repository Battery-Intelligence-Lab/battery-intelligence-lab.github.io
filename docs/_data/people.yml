    bio: David Howey PhD MA MEng SMIEEE is Professor of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, and Official Fellow at St Hilda’s College, Oxford. He received the MEng degree in Electrical and Information Sciences from the University of Cambridge, UK, in 2002 and his PhD from Imperial College London, UK, in 2010, on the topic of thermal management of electrical machines. He was appointed to a faculty position at Oxford in 2011. During his doctoral research he pioneered a new electrical method to measure heat flux in electrical machines. As a post-doc at Imperial he developed and patented an impedance-based battery condition monitoring technique and worked on electrically assisted turbochargers. He was an Honorary Research Fellow at Imperial College London from 2011 to 2014 and winner of a Samsung Global Research Outreach award in 2012. He is on the editorial boards of EES Batteries and Oxford Open Energy and is an IEEE Senior Member and Member of the Electrochemical Society. He has co-authored over 125 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers, and filed 7 patents, and is the recipient of grant funding from EPSRC, the European Union, the Korean Government, InnovateUK, the Faraday Institution, and several companies. He is also co-founder of a spin-out company, <a href="https://brillpower.com/news/">Brill Power Ltd.</a>, and of the award-winning <a href="https://batterymodel.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Battery Modelling Symposium</a>. He teaches a range of topics including electrochemical energy technology, and maths. <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/climate-and-environment/david-howey">Read more</a> about Prof Howey's research.
