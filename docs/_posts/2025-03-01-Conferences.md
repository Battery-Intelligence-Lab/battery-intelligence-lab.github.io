It's been an exciting spring for several of us. Professor Howey gave a keynote presentation at [ModVal](https://events.hs-offenburg.de/event/471/) in Karlsruhe, Germany, and spoke at [Duncanfest](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/control/events/), a celebration of the remarkable career of [Prof Stephen Duncan](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/stephen-duncan/). Joe Ross and others travelled to one of our favourite conferences, [Kraftwerk Batterie](https://battery-power.eu/en/advanced-battery-power/) in Aachen, and Nicola Courtier spoke at [MATSUS](https://www.nanoge.org/MATSUSSpring25/home) in Spain.
