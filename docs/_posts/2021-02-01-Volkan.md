This month we welcome Dr Volkan Kumtepeli who is joining the group as a postdoc, working on the [Energy Superhub Oxford](https://energysuperhuboxford.org/) project. Volkan will be continuing to build our 'digital twin' battery model that enables simulations of large scale energy storage systems, including degradation. Check out [the code for this](https://github.com/davidhowey/SLIDE) on github.
