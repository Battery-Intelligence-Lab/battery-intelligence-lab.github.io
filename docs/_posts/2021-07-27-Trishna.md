Huge congratulations to Trishna Raj who successfully defended her doctoral work on battery aging, investigating 'path dependence' in aging. Can we just combine calendar aging and cyclic aging data? Not always. Read more about this topic in Trishna's [excellent Batteries & Supercaps paper](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/batt.202000160), and [download the associated experimental data](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:de62b5d2-6154-426d-bcbb-30253ddb7d1e) too.
