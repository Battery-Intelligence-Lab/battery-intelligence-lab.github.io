We're delighted to have two Oxford students spending the summer in our team, working on some super exciting [skunkworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project) projects: Han Zhou, who is just finished his 2nd year at St Hilda's, and Federico Ferrari, who has just finished 4th year at LMH.
