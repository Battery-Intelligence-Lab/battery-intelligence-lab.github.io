Just before spring, Christoph invited the team to his home in the Sankt Anton ski resort in Austria for the second edition of the EPG ski trip. The excellent end-of-winter weather created a great atmosphere to improve our skiing. Without major accidents,  beginners risked their first black pistes and more experienced skiers made some long trips through the extensive resort. The world-famous apr√®s-ski scene provided an enjoyable way to recover after a long day. At the end of the week, everybody was exhausted but ready to continue research with a clear mind!
