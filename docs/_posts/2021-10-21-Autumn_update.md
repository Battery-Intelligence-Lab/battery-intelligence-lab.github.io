A warm welcome to new group members Becky Perriment, Zihao Zhou and Masaki Adachi who arrived in October and will respectively be working on solar-battery off-grid systems, lifetime modelling, and machine learning. We were sad to say goodbye to Dr Jie Lin in September who has moved to take up a new position at UCL. You can read about Jie's exciting research on coupled thermal-electrochemical modelling [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12903).
