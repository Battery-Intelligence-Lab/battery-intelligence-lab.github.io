Battery degradation leads to irreversible reductions in capacity and power capability. Some degradation mechanisms can cause safety hazards, such as internal short circuits and thermal runaway. For energy storage to be adopted at scale it is essential to both diagnose present capacity and power capability and predict future behaviour, as well as identifying safety risks originating from particular modes of degradation. We are developing new approaches to diagnosis and prognosis by conducting long-term degradation experiments under realistic conditions and developing new models and tools to diagnose and predict degradation in real applications.
